## Relevant Swarthmore Data

We had a very hard time finding data that pertained to women in STEM so we will just present what we were able to find. 

We combed through the 2016-2017 Common Data Set [Common Data Set](http://www.swarthmore.edu/sites/default/files/assets/documents/institutional-research/CDS_2016-17.pdf), Class of 2016 Graduation Statistics[2016 Grad Stats](http://www.swarthmore.edu/sites/default/files/assets/documents/institutional-research/Graduation%20Statistics%20Class%20of%202016.pdf) (denoted by a *) and gathered the data that might be helpful to the reader's understanding of Swarthmore's current student profile. 

Out of the 1620 undergraduates total enrolled at Swarthmore, 823 are women (50.8%) and 796 are men (49.1%). Out of the 220 instiutional faculty (including full and part time), 102 are women (46.4%) and 118 are men (53.6%). It is interesting to note that out of these 220 faculty members, only 47 are members of minority groups (21.4%).
