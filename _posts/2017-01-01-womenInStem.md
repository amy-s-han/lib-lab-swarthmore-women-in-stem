# **Women in STEM**

## A Lib/Lab Fellowship Project
{: .text-white}


We wanted to take this opportunity to explore issues of women in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) fields at Swarthmore College. While we recognize this is only a cursory investigation and does not cover all the important issues of under-represented people in STEM, we wanted to make headway into at least one of these areas. Additionally, you might notice that all our data is in binary male/female denominations and this is because there currently is no data availible on non-binary enrollment.
